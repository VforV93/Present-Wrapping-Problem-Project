# Present-Wrapping-Problem-Project
Project Work - Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installation for Windows

```
Python Version 3.6
Anaconda 1.9.12
```

### Installing

Create a new conda enviroment
```
conda create -n PWP python=3.6
```

Install all the packeges listed in requirements.txt
```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

## Running the CP model
At first it is necessary to run all the cells before the CP part of the notebook (*imports*-1Â° cell, *Accessory Functions* cells)\
The general use of the model is the following:
- having a reference model **model_name**="model name"
- having an instance **instance_name**="instance name"
- load the instance in order to have: **pr_w**(paper roll's width), **pr_h**(paper roll's height), **n_pieces**(number of pieces in that instance), **L**(the dimension of each pieces)
- running the Minizinc model using python(inside the notebook) to get the solution/s
- using the *print_solutions* function to have a graphically solution/s printing
- using the *save_solution* function to store locally one or more solutions for that instance

### TEST 1.1
Number of solutions (#) and failures when looking for all solutions to some instances of the PW problem, comparing the ordering of pieces or not, using the default search.

- Inside the model(**pwp_v8.mzn**) set 'bool: independent_solving_on_w = false;'(line 22)
- Comment all the search_ann lines at the end of the model(from line 77 to 82)
- Comment also the **"Symmetry breaking rules"** part(from line 52 to 54)
- run the test three times changing the value to the variable **ord_type**('no-ord'|'ord'|'decr-ord')

### TEST 2
Number of failures when looking for all solutions(with symm breaking) using different search heuristics (managed the descending order inside the model based on the area value).

- (**as before**) Inside the model(**pwp_v8.mzn**) set 'bool: independent_solving_on_w = false;'(line 22)
- Comment and uncomment by hands from the first search_ann line to the last (from line 77 to 82)
- (**as before**) **Uncomment** also the **"Symmetry breaking rules"** part(from line 52 to 54)
- run the test two times changing the value to the variable **ord_type**('ord'|'decr-ord')

**Input-min: The best search strategy**.\
Using that searching strategy I am able to solve all the instances in 13 seconds(with 312514 as total **failures**)

### ROTATION (point 5)
A second model has been implemented taking into consideration the possible rotation of each pieces. For more details on the model see **Model.pdf**. \
As for the main model(pwp_v8) it is possible to load any instance we want and to run the **"pwp_v8-rot.mzn"** model. All the solutions are printed out as demonstration. 

### SAME DIMENSION (point 6)
A third model has been implemented taking into consideration the possibility of having instances in which there are 2 or more pieces with the same dimension(same widths and heights). For more details on the model see **Model.pdf**.\
A specific instance, *8x8-same-dim.txt* has been created and added to the *Instances* folder.\
As for the main model(pwp_v8) it is possible to load any instance we want before running the "**pwp_v8-same-dim**" model. All the solutions are printed out as demonstration.

## Running the SMT model
At first it is necessary to run all the cells before the CP part of the notebook (*imports*-1Â° cell, *Accessory Functions* cells)\
The general use of the model is the following:
- having a reference function model (e.g. *create_model*)
- (the same in CP) having an instance **instance_name**="instance name"
- (the same in CP) load the instance in order to have: **pr_w**(paper roll's width), **pr_h**(paper roll's height), **n_pieces**(number of pieces in that instance), **L**(the dimension of each pieces)
- running the function model(*model = create_model(pr_w, pr_h, n_pieces, L)*) using python(inside the notebook) to get the model
- instantiating the Solver, adding the model and running the solver(*res = s.check()*)
- (the same in CP) using the *print_solutions* function to have a graphically solution/s printing
- (the same in CP) using the *save_solution* function to store locally one or more solutions for that instance

For all the instances are been founded at least one solution in an acceptable time.

### ROTATION (point 5)
A second function model(**create_model_with_rotation**) has been implemented taking into consideration the possible rotation of each pieces. For more details on the model see **Model.pdf**. \
As for the main function model(create_model) it is possible to load any instance we want and to use the solver to get the solution. A solution of the 9x9 instance is printed out as demonstration. 

### SAME DIMENSION (point 6)
A third function model has been implemented(**create_model_same_dim**) taking into consideration the possibility of having instances in which there are 2 or more pieces with the same dimension(same widths and heights). For more details on the model see **Model.pdf**.\
A specific instance, *8x8-same-dim.txt* has been created and added to the *Instances* folder.\
As for the main function model(create_model) it is possible to load any instance we want before using the solver to get the solution. A solution is printed out as demonstration.
